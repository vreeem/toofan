## Features

- **Two modes** : English words or real code snippets
- **Hand-written code lessons** : Practical, self-contained examples that teach a concept while you type
- **Infinite mode** : No timer, type the full snippet at your own pace
- **Lesson picker** : Choose what to practice instead of getting random code
- **Live WPM** : Speed updates in real time as you type
- **Personal bests** : Tracked per duration and mode
- **Activity map** : Track how consistent you are across days
- **Backup and restore** : Save your data and import it on any machine
- **Multiple themes** : Match your terminal aesthetic
- Press `?` inside the app for all available keybindings

## Code Snippets

Type real, practical code instead of random keywords. Each snippet is a small, self-contained example that builds muscle memory for `{}`, `=>`, `()`, `<-`, and all the symbols you actually use. Pick a lesson with `ctrl+o` or let it choose randomly. Set the timer to `∞` and the test ends when you finish the snippet.

I've always wanted my terminal to look good and match my setup. So toofan comes with multiple themes you can cycle through to match your aesthetic. Hit `ctrl+t` to switch.

## FAQ

<details>
<summary>How are stats calculated?</summary>

```text
raw      = total_chars / 5 / elapsed_minutes
wpm      = (total_chars - uncorrected_errors) / 5 / elapsed_minutes
accuracy = (total_chars - all_mistakes) / total_chars × 100
```

- **wpm** - your net speed. Every 5 characters count as one "word". Uncorrected mistakes are subtracted.
- **accuracy** - counts every wrong keystroke, even if you corrected it with backspace.
- **raw** - your gross speed before any penalty.
- **errors** - press `e` on the results page to see exactly which words you mistyped.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How are ranks decided?</summary>

Your rank is based on your average WPM over the last 10 word-mode tests:

```text
grandma      # below 30 wpm
noob         # 30 to 50 wpm
mid          # 50 to 80 wpm
tryhard      # 80 to 120 wpm
toofan       # 120+ wpm
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Where are my files stored?</summary>

Everything lives in `~/.toofan/` as plain text files:

- `config.txt` : Your selected duration, mode, language, and theme
- `results.txt` : Every test result (date, wpm, accuracy, duration, mode)
- `pb.txt` : Your personal bests per mode and duration
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I backup my data?</summary>

Yes. Press `ctrl+s` to save a backup and `ctrl+r` to restore from one. Backups are saved to `~/Toofan/` and can be moved between machines.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Does it work offline?</summary>

Yes. Everything runs locally and is embedded in the binary. No internet needed.
</details>
