```

### Build from Source

## FAQ

<details>
<summary>How are stats calculated?</summary>

```text
raw      = total_chars / 5 / elapsed_minutes
wpm      = (total_chars - uncorrected_errors) / 5 / elapsed_minutes
accuracy = (total_chars - all_mistakes) / total_chars × 100
```

- **wpm** - your net speed. Every 5 characters count as one "word". Uncorrected mistakes are subtracted.
- **accuracy** - counts every wrong keystroke, even if you corrected it with backspace.
- **raw** - your gross speed before any penalty.
- **errors** - press `e` on the results page to see exactly which words you mistyped.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Where are my files stored?</summary>

Everything lives in `~/.config/toofan/` as plain text files:

- `config.txt` : Your selected duration, mode, language, and theme
- `results.txt` : Every test result (date, wpm, accuracy, duration, mode)
- `pb.txt` : Your personal bests per mode and duration
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I backup my data?</summary>

Yes. Press `ctrl+s` to save a backup and `ctrl+r` to restore from one. Backups are saved to `~/.config/toofan/backups/` and can be moved between machines.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How do I uninstall Toofan?</summary>

If you installed via the `curl` Quick Install, simply delete the binary and the configuration folder:

```bash
rm ~/.local/bin/toofan
rm -rf ~/.config/toofan
```
*(If you built it from source and moved it globally, run `sudo rm /usr/local/bin/toofan` instead).*
</details>

<details>
<summary>Does it work offline?</summary>

Yes. Everything runs locally and is embedded in the binary. No internet needed.
</details>
